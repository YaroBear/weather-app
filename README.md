## Features
- Caching system via localStorage: checks to see whether an api call was made or cached within the last hour, to stay under the limit of 60 polls/minute per the requirements of openweathermap free tier.

- Sundial: The app displays an animation of a sundial that goes accordingly with the time of day, based of sunrise/set times.

- Very nice weather animations by Josh Bader: http://codepen.io/joshbader/pen/EjXgqr. Slighly modified to my taste and color scheme.
